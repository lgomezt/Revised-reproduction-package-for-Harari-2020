# Table 5, Impact of city shape on rents

"""
Table 5 reports the same set of specifications for housing rents. The dependent 
variable is the 2008âˆ’2006 difference of the log yearly housing rent per square meter, 
averaged throughout all urban households in the district, from National Sample 
Survey data. The evidence presented suggest that lower rents are present in less
compact cities

# Interpretation of results
"""
the effect of disconnected shapes on rents is negative in IV and near to zero 
in OLS. According to the author, the finding of higher wages and lower rents 
in non-compact cities is consistent with a compensating differential interpretation. 

In the model developed, if compact city shape provides advantages in terms of 
quality of life or productivity, compact cities will be characterized by higher 
rents and wages that may be higher or lower depending on whether households or 
firms value compact shape the most. To the extent that households value city 
shape more than firms, they will bid wages up in compact cities.
